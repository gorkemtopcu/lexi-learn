# LexiLook (Language Learning Web App)

## Overview

LexiLook is a web application designed to support language learners by providing comprehensive, structured information about words. Users can input any word and receive detailed data including definitions, translations, usage examples, parts of speech, and potentially pronunciation or etymology.

## Key Features

- Word lookup based on user input query
- Support for multiple languages (planned for future releases)
- Clean, intuitive, and learner-friendly user interface
- Modular and scalable backend API delivering word data
- Integration with free dictionary API ([Dictionary API](https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/<word>))
- Efficient and complex state management using Zustand

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React / Next.js with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for UI components
- **Backend:** Modular API layer (Node.js/Next.js API Routes or serverless functions)
- **Database:** Firebase Firestore for user data and app state persistence
- **State Management:** Zustand for managing complex frontend state beyond Reactâ€™s built-in capabilities

## Engineering Standards and Best Practices

### Code Quality & Maintainability

- Adhere to clean code principles: readability, simplicity, and modularity
- Consistent use of TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Follow established linting and formatting rules (ESLint, Prettier)
- Write clear, concise documentation and comments
- Implement reusable and composable UI components with accessibility in mind

### Testing & Reliability

- Write unit and integration tests (using Jest, React Testing Library) for critical components and API endpoints
- Use end-to-end testing (Cypress or Playwright) for key user flows
- Continuously run tests via CI/CD pipelines before deployments

### Performance & Scalability

- Optimize React rendering and API calls to minimize unnecessary re-renders and network requests
- Implement lazy loading and code splitting for better initial load times
- Design database queries and data fetching for scalability and low latency (e.g., use Firestore indexing and caching)
- Use Zustand efficiently to manage complex and global state without over-fetching or redundant updates

### Security

- Validate and sanitize user inputs on both frontend and backend
- Secure API keys and sensitive credentials using environment variables and secrets management
- Implement authentication and authorization as the app evolves (Firebase Auth or custom solutions)

### Collaboration & Development Workflow

- Use Git feature branching and pull requests with code reviews
- Follow semantic commit messages and maintain a changelog
- Document API contracts clearly for frontend-backend integration
- Maintain an up-to-date README and onboarding documentation

## Senior Developer Best Practices for LexiLook Development

A senior developer building LexiLook would:

1. **Plan for scalability and modularity:** Architect the app so that new languages, features, and integrations can be added without significant refactoring. Design APIs with versioning and extensibility in mind.

2. **Implement robust state management:** Use Zustand strategically to handle complex states such as user sessions, search histories, UI themes, and caching word data, ensuring a smooth user experience without redundant re-renders.

3. **Prioritize user experience and accessibility:** Build UI components that are responsive, keyboard-navigable, and meet WCAG accessibility standards to ensure inclusivity.

4. **Automate testing and deployment:** Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, linting, and deployment, reducing manual errors and speeding up release cycles.

5. **Maintain high code quality:** Enforce strict type checking with TypeScript, comprehensive test coverage, and peer code reviews to prevent bugs and ensure maintainability.

6. **Monitor and optimize:** Use performance monitoring tools and logging to identify bottlenecks and errors in production, iterating quickly based on real user feedback.

7. **Foster collaboration:** Write clear documentation, maintain coding standards, and facilitate knowledge sharing within the team.
