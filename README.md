# Project: LexiLook (Language Learning Web App)

## Overview
LexiLook is a web application designed to support language learners. The app allows users to input a word and returns structured information about the word, such as definitions, translations, usage examples, part of speech, and possibly pronunciation or etymology.

## Key Features
- Word lookup by user query
- Support for multiple languages (in future)
- Clean, learner-friendly UI
- Modular backend API to serve word data
- Designed for scalability

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- Frontend: React / Next.js (shadcn)
- Database: Firebase (Firestore)

## Goals
- Help users understand and remember words
- Use free dictionary API for word data (https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/<word>)
